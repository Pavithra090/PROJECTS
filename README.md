# QuantumHire: Decoding Resumes with Qubit Similarity

A quantum-inspired resume analysis and recruitment intelligence system.

🧠 Overview

QuantumHire revolutionizes traditional recruitment by leveraging quantum-inspired computing and advanced NLP to provide accurate, explainable, and intelligent resume analysis. It decodes complex candidate profiles using qubit-based similarity scoring, skill graph visualizations, and gap analysis—helping recruiters match job roles to talent with unmatched precision.

Built for startups, enterprises, and HR consultancies alike, the system operates efficiently even on small datasets and offers a futuristic, bias-aware alternative to manual or keyword-based resume filtering.

Features:

- 🔍 PDF Resume Parsing (with OCR fallback)
- ⚛️ Quantum-Inspired Similarity Scoring
- 🧮 Skill Gap Analysis
- 🌐 Visual Resume Mapping (Graph-based)
- 🧠 AI-Generated Shortlist Justifications
- 📊 Resume Ranking Engine
- 📚 Personalized Learning Path Generator
- 📈 Heatmaps & Radar Charts for Insights
- 📄 Executive PDF & JSON Report Generation
- 👥 Team Composition Analyzer with Synergy Metrics

Modules

1. PDF Input Module
Robust multi-format resume extraction using traditional and OCR-based methods. Outputs structured JSON.

2. Team Composition Analyzer
Optimizes team-building through skill synergy, graph-based collaboration modeling, and hiring sequence prediction.

3. Resume Ranking Engine
Ranks resumes using a hybrid model combining rule-based and ML scoring. Includes A/B testing and bias detection.

4. Shortlist Justification Generator
NLG-powered rationale generator tailored to recruiter or executive-level detail.

5. Learning Path Generator
Recommends upskilling paths using MOOCs based on individual skill gaps.

6. Reporting & Analytics
Interactive analytics dashboards with export to PDF/JSON. Blockchain-ready logging and data storytelling features.

Tech Stack

Languages:
- Python 3.9+

⚙️ How It Works

1. Recruiter uploads resumes and/or a job description.
2. NLP extracts candidate skills, education, experience.
3. Job & resume data is encoded using qubit simulation.
4. Entanglement-based scoring ranks candidates by job fit.
5. Gap analysis, visual maps, and learning paths are generated.
6. Team synergy and candidate justifications are reported.
7. Executive summary is exported as a professional PDF.

📈 Future Enhancements

- 🌐 Integration with job portals and LinkedIn via APIs
- 🧑‍💻 GUI/Frontend Dashboard (beyond CLI)
- 🗣️ Voice-enabled Analysis
- 🤖 Reinforcement Learning Feedback Loops
